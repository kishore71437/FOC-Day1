Develop a solution (algorithm, flowchart and pseudocode) to calculate a studentâ€™s grade average for one semester. 
The letter grades should be entered and the grade average printed out.
An A is equivalent to 4 grade points, a B is 3 grade points; a C is 2 grade points, a D is 1 grade point, and an F is zero grade points.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize variables total_grade_points and total_credit_hours to 0.
2. Ask the user to enter the number of courses.
3. For each course:
   a. Ask the user to enter the letter grade.
   b. Convert the letter grade to grade points based on the grading scale.
   c. Ask the user to enter the credit hours for the course.
   d. Multiply the grade points by the credit hours and add the result to the total_grade_points variable.
   e. Add the credit hours to the total_credit_hours variable.
4. Calculate the grade point average by dividing the total_grade_points by the total_credit_hours.
5. Print the grade point average.
